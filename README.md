# tracedletters

During my time as English teacher, I realized how hard it is to find good 
resources for even the most basic of tasks - like practicing the ABC with 
letter tracing worksheets. Don't get me wrong, they are available. But 
they often require payment, registration, attribution or other rather 
annoying limitations on use. That's when I decided to make my own simple 
letter tracing work sheets. No branding, no usage terms, no nothing. 
Feel free to use them anyway you like. Yes, even commercially. 

## Where to get the sheets

If you just want to use the sheets as is, check out the `pdf` directory, 
it contains one file per letter which you can simply grab.

## How to edit the sheets

If you would like to add your branding or otherwise modify these, grab 
the SVG (vector graphics) files from the `svg` directory. Note that you 
will have to install the [Patrick Hand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patrick+Hand) 
font for correct display.

The SVG files have been created with Inkscape, but any program that can 
display SVG files should be able to open these just fine.

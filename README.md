# tracedletters

When I was teaching English, I realized how hard it is to find good free 
resources for even the most basic of tasks - like practicing the ABC with 
letter tracing worksheets. Don't get me wrong, they are available. But 
they often require payment, registration, attribution or other rather 
annoying limitations on use. That's when I decided to make my own simple 
letter tracing work sheets. Feel free to use them anyway you like.

# tracedletters

During my time as English teacher, I realized how hard it is to find good 
resources for even the most basic of tasks - like practicing the ABC with 
letter tracing worksheets. Don't get me wrong, they are available. But 
they often require payment, registration, attribution or other rather 
annoying limitations on use. That's when I decided to make my own simple 
letter tracing work sheets. No branding, no usage terms, no nothing. 
Feel free to use them anyway you like. Yes, even commercially. 

## Where to get the sheets

Check out the `pdf` directory, it contains one PDF file per letter. The 
letters have been turned into paths on export, which means you don't need 
to install any fonts.

## How to edit the sheets

If you would like to add your branding or otherwise modify the sheets, grab 
the SVG (vector graphics) files from the `svg` directory. Note that you will 
have to install the [Patrick Hand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patrick+Hand) 
font for correct display.

The SVG files have been created with Inkscape, but any program that can 
edit SVG files, like Adobe Illustrator, should be able to open these just fine.
